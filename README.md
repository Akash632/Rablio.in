1. Fetched the given API to display the information of employees. In this assignment, I have used redux. So I have fetced the value and added it to store of Redux.

2. Implemented a search option with a search button. User can search the employees from the list using their Ids. 

3. All cards are clickable. When the user clicks on the image of the card or on the edit button, he will be navigated to the detailed user information page for which I have used dynamic routing.

4. I have provided a deleted button on every card. When the user clicks on the button that particular card will be deleted from the store.

5. Following the bonus feature, I have provided small check boxes on every card. When the user selects the check box and click on the delete button displayed below the search container the cards he selected will get deleted.
